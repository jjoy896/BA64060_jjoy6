This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(factoextra)
library(dplyr)
#laptop Data Import
wines = read.csv("C:\\wine-clustering.csv")
```

# Q1-A Explain how normalization and the number of clusters (k) can affect the clustering outcome?
When performing clustering the normalization of data as well as the number of clusters *k* is important in producing acurate outcomes. Clustering depends on the use of a distance metric commonly the euclidean distance, because of this if our data has different scales one variable could over take the others causing our model to not utilize all the relevant information. This leads to clusters that may not represent actual clusters and will only create clusters based on the highest scaled variable.
The number of clusters selected will also effect the outcome, accuracy, and meaningfulness of the results. If a small value of clusters *k* is used there may not be enough groups to sort the observations in a proper way, this can lead to lose of important patterns and clusters that should be separate will can end up being merged to fit the value of *k*. On the other hand if to high of a value of *k* is used there may be too many clusters to give any meaning fulling interpretations. A large number for *k* may also result in clusters that should not be split up being broken up into multiple clusters to satisfy our value for *k*. One final issue with a large value of *k* could mean clusters may be formed with too few observations making them not as meaningful. 


# Q1-B Code
```{r}
#Check the structure of the data
str(wines)

#summary check
summary(wines)

#Check for missing values
colMeans(is.na(wines))

#Normalize data
wines.norm = scale(wines)

#finding a optimal value for k using Elbow Method
fviz_nbclust(wines.norm, kmeans, method = "wss")

```

# Q1-B Explinations




Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
