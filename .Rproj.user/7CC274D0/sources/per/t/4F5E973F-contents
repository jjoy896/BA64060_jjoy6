# Q2-C  
Looking at the the median levels of Alcohol content the median for Low and Medium both are close to the maximum value before moving up to the next range of Alcohol level. This is important because it tells use that the differences between our groups is very small when looking at just Alchohol level, but is important for determining taste and profile in wine. We would not want this information to be lost when clustering. There is chance that overlap would occur between low and medium; medium and high. The median values of Ash content show that the median for the low content is close to the next range at the moderate level, however they are both further from the high median value category. This could indicate that we may have clustering of low and moderate but high would be its own cluster. From the Median of Color Intensity the median values indicate a much large distinction between all three categories, this would make color intensity a useful variable in determining our clusters because of the large seen difference in medians.  
Overall the characteristics of the wine data suggest a cluster size of 3 would be useful and that there are subtle differences between category of wine that must not be lost when forming clusters.

# Q3-A Additional cluster plot
```{r}
agnes.grp = cutree(agnes_ward, k = 3)
fviz_cluster(list(data = wines_n.norm, cluster = agnes.grp))
```

# Q3-A
For the wine data it is more appropriate to use AGNES over DIANA for clustering. In both cases I made a cut line that would create 3 clusters, based on the dendograms, as well as their being 3 categories for some characteristics, and 3 different cultivators. The dendogram that is created from AGNES indicates one cluster of wine that is very different from the rest due to the large length of the vertical line before more splits. The other group that is made is split into 2 one vertical line is just slightly longer then the other indicating their is a gradual difference between them. This however seems appropriate for the nature of wine and its characteristics included in our data. This was noted in the comparison of the median values above. It also appears that select 3 as the cluster value allowed for similar sized clusters. This is something to note but was not the reason the number of clusters chosen was three.  
While looking at the dendogram for DIANA I again went with 3 clusters, my other thought was to have a cut line at a height of 8 but this would produce ~7 clusters and did not feel that these would be as meaningful based on the data. The vertical lines in DIANA are shorter then with AGNES indicating that the small differences between the observations is being lost, this is important to note because the small differences in chemical make up can change the taste of wine by a large amount. Finally, when looking at our AC (0.942) vs DC (0.800) we see that the AC is much closer to 1 and is .14 higher then DC indicating stronger clustering structure when using AGNES.  
One other observation is made based on the visualization of the clusters provided above. Clusters 1 and 2 have some overlap again suggesting that the wines have small variations and gradually change. This is fine in this analysis because of the nature of wine, but is worth pointing out depending on the goal and questions being asked in an analysis.

# Q3-B
I do not feel that another clustering method would be more suitable for this data. The hierarchical methods we used and specifically AGNES based on the analysis would produce more significant results that reflect the small changes in wine which determine taste. Hierarchical clustering is more useful when there is a natural order to the data you are working with, wine in this case has these properties especially because of the complexity of each bottle(grapes/year/region/etc) if we were to use a different clustering method we may miss out on a natural group such as reds from 2000 (hypothetical). While this is just an example this would be lost if we only wanted to find a set number of clusters such as red/white/rose. Hierarchical clustering and the dendograms they produce allow for sub clustering to be seen and interpreted. Based on our results we saw a distinct separation between at least two groups and then the first group was split again, we saw the overlapping change in the clusters when ploted and was supported by the dendogram. We can also see that our groups appear to have different densities which would make Kmeans less useful. From assignment 5 we saw that kmeans gave us 3 distinct clusters and DBSCAN was only able to provide 1 cluster (based on best practices for determining epsilon and minPts). We could infer that the DBSCAN cluster could be labeled for the region of Italy our data came from but this would not really be useful as it misses clustering similarities beyond the most obvious. For these reasons hierarchical clustering is the better method for this data.
